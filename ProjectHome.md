This project aims at the creation of a system that can be used for the creation, maintenance and timing of answers to (programming) excersises.

It is primarely aimed at PHP/Mysql courses and other webbased programming solutions. It makes use of the Geshi source code highlighter.

Typically you would use a system like this in a programming course where you would like to give the answers to programming problems to your student, but not immediately. They first have to try to find the solutions themselves.

An other aspect of this project is the showing of code-in-action and code-in-face at the same time, so students can wee wat a script does and what the source code of the script is.

It is very much a work in progress...
